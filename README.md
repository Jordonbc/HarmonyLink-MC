### Getting Started

Follow these detailed steps to set up and start using the HarmonyLink Minecraft Mod:

1. **Install Minecraft Forge / Fabric:** The first step is to ensure you have Minecraft Forge or Fabric installed on your device. These are mod loaders that allow Minecraft to use mods like HarmonyLink. You can download these from their official websites.

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/Jordonbc/HarmonyLinkServer/releases/latest/download/harmonylink_installer.desktop). Follow the instructions on the website to install it correctly.
5. **Launch Minecraft:** Now that everything is set up, it's time to launch Minecraft. Ensure that the game is launched with Forge or Fabric, which will then load the HarmonyLink Mod.
